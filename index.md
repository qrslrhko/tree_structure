## Application of using instanced rendering in OpenGL

- type 1:
There are three levels branches in this tree. I used many group of leves in each level. In the top level, there is only one group of level, but in the second level, there are 15 group of leaves, and there are 25 group of leves in the third level. Each group of leaves has 100 amount of leaves. The original leaf model is very large, I have to shrink the leaf model a lot.
### type 1 
I used leaf model with basic lighting in type 1.

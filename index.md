## Application of using instanced rendering in OpenGL


There are three levels in this tree. I used many group of leves in each level. In the top level, there is only one group of level, but in the second level, there are 15 group of leaves, and there are 25 group of leves in the third level. Each group of leaves has 100 amount of leaves. 
### type 1 
Leaf model(no textures) with basic lighting in type 1. Because the leaf model is very large, I have to shrink the leaf model many time. In order to let program run fast. I only use leaf model and basic lighting. Here, the basic lighting, including ambient, diffuse, and specular is for showing the shape of leaves.
